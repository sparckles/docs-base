## File Uploads

Batman learned how to handle file uploads using Robyn. He created an endpoint to handle file uploads using the following code:


## Scaling the Application

<Row>
<Col>
Batman scaled his application across multiple cores for better performance. He used the following command:
</Col>
  <Col sticky>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
    from robyn.robyn import File

    @app.post("/upload")
    async def upload():
      body = request.body
      file = bytearray(body)

      # write whatever filename
      with open('test.txt', 'wb') as f:
          f.write(body)

      return jsonify({'message': 'success'})
    ```
    ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
    from robyn.robyn import File

    @app.post("/upload")
    async def upload():
      body = request.body
      file = bytearray(body)

      # write whatever filename
      with open('test.txt', 'wb') as f:
          f.write(body)

      return jsonify({'message': 'success'})
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

## File Downloads

Batman now wanted to allow users to download files from his application. He created an endpoint to handle file downloads using the following code:


### Serving Simple HTML Files

<Row>
<Col>
Batman scaled his application across multiple cores for better performance. He used the following command:
</Col>
  <Col sticky>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
    from robyn import Robyn, serve_html

    app = Robyn(__file__)


    @app.get("/")
    async def h(request):
        return serve_html("./index.html")

    app.start(port=8080)

    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
    from robyn import Robyn, Request, serve_html

    app = Robyn(__file__)


    @app.get("/")
    async def h(request: Request):
        return serve_html("./index.html")

    app.start(port=8080)

    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

### Serving Other Files


<Row>
<Col>
Batman scaled his application across multiple cores for better performance. He used the following command:
</Col>
  <Col sticky>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
    from robyn import Robyn, serve_file

    app = Robyn(__file__)


    @app.get("/")
    async def h(request):
        return serve_file("./index.html")

    app.start(port=8080)

    ```

    ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
    from robyn import Robyn, serve_file, Request

    app = Robyn(__file__)


    @app.get("/")
    async def h(request: Request):
        return serve_file("./index.html")

    app.start(port=8080)

    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>


## What's next?

Now, Batman was ready to learn about the advanced features of Robyn. He wanted to find a way to get realtime updates in his dashboard.
