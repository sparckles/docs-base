As the codebase grew, Batman wanted to have a way to organise the code. Robyn told him that he had the super power to organise the code in a better way. He told him about the concept of views and subrouters.

## Views



<Row>
<Col>
To organise your code in a better way - either to group by responsibility or for code splitting, you can use views.

A view, simply is a function with a collection of other closures. e.g.
</Col>
  <Col sticky>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

    ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
    def sample_view():
      def get():
          return "Hello, world!"

      def post(request):
          body = request.body
          return {"status_code": 200, "description": body}

    ```

    ```python {{title: 'typed'}}
      from robyn import Request

      def sample_view():
        def get():
            return "Hello, world!"

        def post(request: Request):
            body = request.body
            return {"status_code": 200, "description": body}
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>
The above view contains two closures for the get and the post request.

You can serve views in two ways:
<Row>

  <Col>
  Using an `@app.view` decorator.
  </Col>
  <Col sticky>
    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

      ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
      @app.view("/sync/view/decorator")
      def sync_decorator_view():
       def get():
           return "Hello, world!"

       def post(request):
           body = request.body
           return {"status_code": 200, "description": body}

      ```
      ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
      from robyn import Request

      @app.view("/sync/view/decorator")
      def sync_decorator_view():
       def get():
           return "Hello, world!"

       def post(request: Request):
           body = request.body
           return {"status_code": 200, "description": body}

      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

<Row>
  <Col>
  Using an `@app.view` decorator.
  </Col>
  <Col sticky>
    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

      ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
        from .views import sample_view

        ...
        ...

        app.add_view("/", sample_view)
      ```
      ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
        from .views import sample_view

        ...
        ...

        app.add_view("/", sample_view)
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

## Subrouters




<Row>

  <Col>

Batman can create subrouters in Robyn. This is useful when you want to group routes together.

Subrouters can be used for both normal routes and web sockets. They are basically a mini version of the main router and can be used in the same way.

The only thing to remember is that you need to add the subrouter to the main router.
  </Col>
  <Col sticky>
    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/hello_world">

      ```python {{ title: 'untyped' }}
      from robyn import Robyn, SubRouter

      app = Robyn(__file__)

      sub_router = SubRouter("/sub_router")

      @sub_router.get("/hello")
      def hello():
          return "Hello, world"

      web_socket = SubRouter("/web_socket")

      @web_socket.message()
      async def hello():
          return "Hello, world"

      app.include_router(sub_router)
      ```


      ```python {{ title: 'typed' }}
      from robyn import Robyn, SubRouter

      app = Robyn(__file__)

      sub_router = SubRouter("/sub_router")

      @sub_router.get("/hello")
      def hello():
          return "Hello, world"

      web_socket = SubRouter("/web_socket")

      @web_socket.message()
      async def hello():
          return "Hello, world"

      app.include_router(sub_router)
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Col>
</Row>

## What's next?

Batman, being the familiar with the dark side wanted to know about Exceptions!

Robyn introduced him to the concept of exceptions and how he can use them to handle errors in his application.
